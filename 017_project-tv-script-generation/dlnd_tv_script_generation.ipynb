    "## Build the Neural Network\n",
    "Implement an RNN using PyTorch's [Module class](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html#torch.nn.Module). You may choose to use a GRU or an LSTM. To complete the RNN, you'll have to implement the following functions for the class:\n",
    " - `__init__` - The initialize function. \n",
    " - `init_hidden` - The initialization function for an LSTM/GRU hidden state\n",
    " - `forward` - Forward propagation function.\n",
    " \n",
    "The initialize function should create the layers of the neural network and save them to the class. The forward propagation function will use these layers to run forward propagation and generate an output and a hidden state.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The output of this model should be the *last* batch of word scores** after a complete sequence has been processed. That is, for each input sequence of words, we only want to output the word scores for a single, most likely, next word.\n",

    "### Hints\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make sure to stack the outputs of the lstm to pass to your fully-connected layer, you can do this with `lstm_output = lstm_output.contiguous().view(-1, self.hidden_dim)`\n",
    "2. You can get the last batch of word scores by shaping the output of the final, fully-connected layer like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# reshape into (batch_size, seq_length, output_size)\n",
    "output = output.view(batch_size, -1, self.output_size)\n",
